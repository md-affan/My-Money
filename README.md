Monthly SIP payments.
Monthly change rate (loss or growth) for each type of fund.
The output should be:

Balanced amount of each fund for a certain month.

Assumptions
From Problem Statement
The money allocated in equity, debt and gold funds.
Monthly SIP payments.
Monthly change rate (loss or growth) for each type of fund.
Additional Assumptions Made
Only 3 allocation class are currently available.
The default input order for asset class is - EQUITY, DEBT, GOLD.
All the inputs must be explicitly provided, no default value as 0 is used.
SIP, Change percentages can be declared only once for a month.
The system only works for 1-year (Jan-Dec) as there is no way to distinguish between years from input.
