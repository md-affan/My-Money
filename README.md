Problem Statement : 
MyMoney platform lets investors consolidated portfolio value across equity, debt, and gold. We need to ensure that the desired allocation percentages are equal to the actual percentages invested. The desired allocation percentage should be derived from the initial allocation made.

The program should take as input : 
1. The money allocated in equity, debt and gold funds.
2. Monthly SIP payments.
3. Monthly change rate (loss or growth) for each type of fund.


The output should be:
1. Balanced amount of each fund for a certain month.
2. Rebalanced amount of each month if applicable.


The supported commands are :
ALLOCATE, SIP, CHANGE, BALANCE, REBALANCE
